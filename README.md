# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

In order to make Horiseon's website ADA compliant and easier to read, code was simplified as to reduce redundancies and comments were added to the 
CSS file so it can be easier to understand. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
